- Proud to announce the release of React Unity WebGL version 10.0.0 while celebrating 8 years of React Unity WebGL! This version includes several important updates and fixes, including the removal of the `unload` function, which is no longer necessary to unmount the Unity Application. The Unity Application will automatically be unmounted when the component is removed from the DOM. However, if you want to unload the Unity Application manually, you can still use the `unload` function, but be aware that this is not necessary in most cases.
