# Unloading the Unity Application

Requests the Unity Application to be unloaded from memory in order to be unmounted from the DOM.

## Type Definition

```tsx title="Type Definition"
function unload(): Promise<void> | undefined;
```

## Implementation

:::info
The unload function is only available in Unity Builds created with Unity 2020.1 or later.
:::

:::warning
Normally it was possible to unmount the Unity Application and unmount the containing component right after the unload function was invoked, but due to a bug in newer Unity version this is no longer possible when using a builds made with Unity 2021.2 or later. It is still possible to unload the Unity Application, but the canvas has to kept mounted until the promise is resolved. As of writing this, the issue has not been fixed, but it is possible to unmount the Unity Application manually by halting the navigation to the next page. A ticket has been openend, this is a know issue by the Unity team. More information can be found on the [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/issues/250).
:::

When building a multi-page React Application, it is important to unload the Unity Application in order to completely unmount the component from the DOM to free up the memory taken by the Unity JavaScript heap, and without Unity throwing an error. Invoking the function will request the Unity Application to be unloaded from memory. The function will return a Promise that will be resolved when the Unity Application has been unloaded.

To get started, destructure the unload function from the Unity Context.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="Example: Destructuring the unload function"
const { unload } = useUnityContext();
```

Next you'll be able to invoke the awaitable unload function to unload the Unity Application.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="Example: Using the take screenshot function"
async function handleClick() {
  await unload();
}

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Unload</button>;
```

## Example Usage

A basic implementation could look something like this. In the following example we'll display a button which allows the user to navigate to another page, but before this happens, the Unity Application will be unloaded.

```jsx showLineNumbers title="App.jsx"
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { Unity, useUnityContext } from "react-unity-webgl";

function App() {
  const { unityProvider, unload } = useUnityContext({
    loaderUrl: "build/myunityapp.loader.js",
    dataUrl: "build/myunityapp.data",
    frameworkUrl: "build/myunityapp.framework.js",
    codeUrl: "build/myunityapp.wasm",
  });

  async function handleClickBack() {
    await unload();
    // Ready to navigate to another page.
  }

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Unity unityProvider={unityProvider} />
      <button onClick={handleClickBack}>Back</button>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```
