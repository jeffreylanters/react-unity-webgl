# Upgrading from version 9

Version 10 is fully compatible with version 9, so you can upgrade without any issues. Version 10 introduces new features and improvements, but it does not break any existing functionality. However, there is one change you should be aware of:

The long-standing unloading issue Unity introduced in Unity 2021.2 has been resolved in React Unity WebGL version 10. This means that you no longer need to call the [unload](/docs/api/unload) function to unmount the Unity Application when using React Unity WebGL version 10.

Happy coding!
